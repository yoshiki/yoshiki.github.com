Want to try out yet another browser? Kevin Gerich has posted on his site: 'This is a <A href="http://www.kmgerich.com/misc.html">Mac OS X build of Phoenix</A> based on version 0.5. It's not a straight build, it's more like "Phoenix and stuff". It is not a Mozilla.org product. Please don't contact Mozilla.org regarding this build as it is not supported.'

Phoenix を Mac OS X 用にbuildしたらしい。
