New in X11 v0.2.1

Installer now defaults to replacing /etc/X11, to use quartz-wm instead of twm.  This is the only change since v0.2.
Support for Gnome, KDE hints
Application windows now cascade instead of piling on top of each if they do not have an explicit placement policy
Added /usr/include/X11 and /usr/lib/X11 symlinks
Menu in the Dock now shows a list of X11 windows.
Support for Copy & Paste working with other window managers.
No-click-to-focus option : “defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm true”
Support for move window events from CodeTek's VirtualDesktop
Support to respect the Mac OS X's International keyboard mapping.
Keymappings from /System/Library/Keyboards.
Support for -iconic. E.g. xterm -iconic now puts the xterm into the Dock on launch.
New preference options to control xauth usage
Bug fixes and other feature enhancements
