Jam less (jless)
Less is one of the best text viewer. It is a successor of more. It allows you to scroll forward, scroll backward, search, etc through multiple text files. 
However, it doesn't support multi bytes characters. So, I made a patch to enhance it in order to view texts with multi character sets using using ISO 2022 code extention techniques. And I also support some code conversion among Japanese encoding schemes, JIS X 0208, JIS X 0213, SJIS, and UJIS. </blockquote>

jlessってjapanese lessじゃなかったのね…。
