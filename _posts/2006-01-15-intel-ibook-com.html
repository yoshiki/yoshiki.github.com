Come April or May, sources maintain that Apple will revamp its iBook line with a new eye-catching industrial design built around a 13-inch widescreen display and low-end Intel Yonah processor. The new iBooks are also expected to be slimmer than their predecessors, but retain robust enclosures that are ideal for education markets.</blockquote>AppleInsider経由の情報によると、Appleが4月か5月にはニューデザインの13インチのiBookを出すとかいう噂があるそうです。うーむ。待つべきか待たざるべきか…。
